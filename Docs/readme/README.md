# JDK version support

MarkdownDoc is now upgraded to Groovy 4.0.1 producing JDK 11 bytecode. 

It is now also, since Groovy 4, possible to specify which level of bytecode to generate. Currently 11 is specified. I am however trying to come up with a clean solution to produce both 11 and 17 and possibly any in between versions, which will be reflected in binary version number. Haven't come up with a good solution for that yet.
