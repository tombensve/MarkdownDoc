    <description>A maven plugin for generating documentation from markdown.</description>

        <!--
            I love maven and version 3.0.5 is very old and very stable! That can unfortunately not be
            said for newer versions of maven. I've always had problems with 3.2, it got a little better
            with 3.3, but still not close to the 3.0 stability. With 3.3 compiling this plugin results
            in an IndexOutOfBoundsException entirely in maven code. I did go through the documentation
            and updated the code using the latest real java annotations. That didn't help, still got
            an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

            I really, really hate JIRA which is a truly crappy piece of software. Usability is a concept
            they never heard of. I'm forced to torture myself with JIRA professionally, but I refuse to do
            so on my personal time. I'm thereby not going to file an issue on this. I'll just stick
            to trusty 3.0.5 which does everything I need it to do.

            About issue handling I can strongly recommend YouTrack. It is everything that JIRA isn't!
            It is a joy to work with. Clearly made by people who knows what they are doing. The JetBrains
            have very clearly thought about how users interact with it, while the Atlassians realized
            far too late "Shit, are we going to have users actually using this ?!!".
