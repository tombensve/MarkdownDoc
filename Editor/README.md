# Editor

This is a Java Swing editor application for writing markdown. It is very distraction free. Move mouse up closer to 
top of window to get a toolbar that includes settings. In the settings you can choose to make formatting characters
very tiny which makes the text much easier to read in edit mode. You can also choose fonts and colors. 

Since the editor is not something you download via maven it can be downloaded [here](https://download.natusoft.se/maven/se/natusoft/tools/doc/markdowndoc/MarkdownDocEditor/3.1.0/MarkdownDocEditor-3.1.0.App.jar).

This is written in Groovy 4 and have version 11 bytecode! There is also a 3.1.0_17 in my repo which have JDK 17 bytecode.
