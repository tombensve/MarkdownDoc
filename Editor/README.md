# Editor

This is a Java Swing editor application for writing markdown. It is very distraction free. Move mouse up closer to 
top of window to get a toolbar that includes settings. In the settings you can choose to make formatting characters
very tiny which makes the text much easier to read in edit mode. You can also choose fonts and colors. 

Since the editor is not something you download via maven it can be downloaded [here](https://download.natusoft.se/maven/se/natusoft/tools/doc/markdowndoc/MarkdownDocEditor/3.0.0/MarkdownDocEditor-3.0.0.App.jar).

This is written in Groovy 3 and thus have 1.8 bytecode! Works with warnings on JDK 11, but probably not above that.
The breaking of backwards compatibility in 12 and up makes things really difficult.
